/**
 * Asks before a dirty editor is left. Every in-app way out (the header's Back,
 * hardware back, a swipe) removes the screen, which `usePreventRemove` holds
 * back until the user picks Discard. On web expo-router also reduces the
 * browser's Back and Forward through removal prevention: it moves the browser
 * back by itself and reports the blocked move as a `RESET` action, whose
 * replay would replace the history entry instead of moving it. So
 * `useBrowserHistoryGuard` holds those moves first, through the shared
 * `popstate` listener the app installs at start (installBrowserBackGuard),
 * and Discard turns removal prevention off before it replays the move, or
 * expo-router would block the replay too. `usePreventRemove` also asks
 * before a reload or tab close on web (`beforeunload`). The guard's effect
 * reaches the browser's events, which only exist outside React: it arms the
 * guard in the shared listener's list (and, until the guard takes its entry,
 * listens for the Navigation API's `currententrychange`). On native it does
 * nothing.
 *
 * After Discard the guard stays off while the screen is left. A move that
 * keeps the screen mounted (a browser Forward covers it) turns it on again
 * when the screen is focused again.
 *
 * The hook calls `useUrl` on every host, native too, so the host re-renders
 * on every URL change, also when the change is not on its own screen.
 *
 * The browser history half needs the Navigation API (`window.navigation`),
 * whose entries say exactly where a `popstate` went: the guard puts the URL
 * back and Discard replays the same move. Every current browser has it. A
 * browser without it gets no browser history guard: its Back and Forward
 * buttons leave a dirty screen without asking. In-app moves, reload and tab
 * close still ask there.
 *
 * Only the focused screen's guard holds a browser move. A move made while
 * another screen covers the dirty one (a screen pushed over it, or another
 * package's tab) goes through, even when it removes the dirty screen: a
 * covered screen is frozen (`freezeOnBlur`), so it cannot show its confirm,
 * and a switch to a package tab visited before replaces the dirty screen's
 * history entry instead of pushing one, so that entry then shows the tab's
 * URL: a hold would put the user back on the tab, not on the dirty screen.
 *
 * With the Navigation API, a browser move off the focused dirty screen goes
 * through when that screen has no entry to put the user back on: its URL
 * never showed the screen's path, so it never took one, or the browser
 * dropped its entry (session history has a cap). A move also goes through
 * inside the short pass window after a confirmed in-app move (see
 * `Expected`). Guards look for a dropped entry when they arm and at each
 * popstate that no guard caused or waits for (`registry.expected` is null);
 * a guard then takes the next entry that shows its screen while it is
 * focused, such as the slot expo-router replaces with the screen's URL on an
 * in-app return. A drop after the guard's last arm, such as the push that
 * brings the screen back being the one that drops its entry, is found only
 * at the popstate of the next browser move, too late to hold it. The first
 * move let through because the focused screen has no entry, whether it never
 * took one or the browser dropped it, logs one warning in the page's life
 * (`forms.leave-guard`). Later ones, moves made while the dirty screen is
 * covered, and moves in the pass window log nothing.
